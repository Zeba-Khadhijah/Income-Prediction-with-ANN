# Income-Prediction-with-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income is above or below USD 50,000 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset used for this project contains various demographic and socio-economic features of individuals, such as age, education level, occupation, and marital status.

The following packages are used in this project:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
tensorflow
scikit-learn

An Artificial Neural Network using Adam optimization and relu activation yielded a prediction accuracy of 81.5% but had unstable loss and accuracy. Optimisation with Learning rate scheduling stabilised the modelâ€™s performance.
