# Income-Prediction-with-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income is above or below USD 50,000 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset used for this project "new_df" is a cleaned and prepared dataset derived from US census data set which is also attached in this repository. The data contains various demographic and socio-economic features of individuals, such as age, education level, occupation, and marital status etc.

The following packages are used in this project:
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. tensorflow
4. scikit-learn

An Artificial Neural Network using Adam optimization and relu activation yielded a prediction accuracy of 81.5% but had unstable loss and accuracy. Optimisation with Learning rate scheduling stabilised the modelâ€™s performance.

The trained and optimised model is saved in the model folder in this repository.
